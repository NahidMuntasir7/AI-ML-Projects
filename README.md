# ML | DL | NLP Projects  🤖

A collection of projects I did while learning Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing.  
Includes experiments, implementations, and code developed to practice and understand concepts better. 🚀

---

Some of the projects included are:  
- **DL1: MNIST Digit Classifier** – Built and trained a neural network to recognize handwritten digits.  
- **DL2: Image Classification (NN vs CNN)** – Compareed performance of fully connected networks and convolutional neural networks.  
- **ML1: Regression on Housing Dataset** – Applied regression models to predict housing prices.  
- **ML2: Diabetes Detection System** – Developed a system to predict diabetes using ML classification models.  
- **ML3: Clustering on Iris Dataset** – Experimented with clustering techniques on the Iris dataset.
