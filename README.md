# ML | DL | NLP Projects  🤖

A collection of projects I did while learning Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing.  
Includes experiments, implementations, and code developed to practice and understand concepts better. 🚀

---

Some of the projects included are:  
- **DL1: MNIST Digit Classifier** – Built and trained a neural network to recognize handwritten digits.  
- **DL2: Image Classification (NN vs CNN)** – Compared the performance of fully connected neural networks and convolutional neural networks.  
- **ML1: Regression on Housing Dataset** – Applied regression models to predict housing prices.  
- **ML2: Diabetes Detection System** – Developed a system to predict diabetes using ML classification models.  
- **ML3: Clustering on Iris Dataset** – Experimented with different clustering techniques on the Iris dataset.  
- **NLP1: TF-IDF vs Word2Vec vs BERT Embedding (IMDB Sentiment Analysis)** – Compared text representation methods for sentiment classification.  
- **NLP2: QA BERT Fine-Tuning on SQuAD Dataset** – Fine-tuned BERT for extractive question answering.  
- **Multilingual Sentence Classifier** – Classified sentences from multiple languages using transformer-based models.  
- **CV1: Object Tracking & Heatmap Visualization** – Object tracking and visualization in video data.
